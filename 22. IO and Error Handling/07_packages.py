# Packages are basically a folder of modules
# We can make our own package, by making a folder in root directory inside an epty __init__.py and then utils file
# Packages are used for organising code, otherwise everything in a single file makes it obfuscated 


# my_package/
#     __init__.py -> Empty file, initializes that folder as a package 
#     calc.py
#     utils.py


import numpy # A package 
import math
